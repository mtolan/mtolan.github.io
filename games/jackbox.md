# Jack-out-the-box

Hi everyone. I had such a great time playing Jackbox with y'all at the party, that I've been considering whether and how we could play it while not in the same room. Honestly I've been thinking of that for a while, this was just some extra impetus to get real about it.

This might be a long treatise on what I think is required, and probably needs to get distilled into a simpler Joining a Game guide, but a design document for how things are supposed to work is also a useful thing to have.

The three key elements that one needs access to in order to enjoy a jackbox experience seem to be:

* Game Video / Audio
* Game Control
* Social Audio / Chat

## Game Control - jackbox.tv

This is the data channel that we have 0 choice about. You're going to need some kind of device (mobile or not) where you can get to jackbox.tv, join games, answer questions and stuff.

## Social Audio / Chat - Discord

While we might try to use a Google Hangout to manage our social audio and chat, creating and maintaining those on a long-lived basis is a little bit of a pain, and it's trickier to set up situations where someone can rejoin after accidentally dropping.

Discord is free, and can be accessed from a web browser without the need to install additional things. It does require signing up for an account, and being invited to our amusingly titled Discord Server.

## Game Video / Audio - YouTube Streaming

After some vendor evaluation that included Twitch, Mixer, YouTube Streaming, Facebook Gaming, 

YouTube Streaming wins on 2 key features: 

1. The ability to avoid having an aggressively exhibitionistic game promoted to a whole bunch of randos on the internet. 

2. The ability to deliver streaming video with the lowest latency of the providers I tried. Twitch adds about 7-10s of latency, so you regularly see the response prompts on your device before the question is done being asked.


## Example Setup

If you have a laptop, you can accomplish all three without installing anything beyond a web browser with three tabs.

Game Video/Audio: YouTube
Game Control: jackbox.tv
Social Audio/Chat: Discord.gg

You'll also need a pair of headphones so that you're not sending Game Audio into the Social Audio feed (this avoids obnoxious feedback and echoes).
