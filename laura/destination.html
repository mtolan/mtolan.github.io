<h2>This is the destination page.</h2>

The important thing about this page is that it has a bunch of content, and some "anchor" elements that can allow a hyperlink to find them.

There's some code here that's not visible unless you're using "view source" or something like it, but it says &lt;a name="speaker1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

<a name="speaker1"></a>
