<section>
<p>The winner of a mixed gaming tournament can only be determined after a group of people play a group of games. The games that players compete in are organized as follows:</p>

<h3>1. Game</h3>
<p>A game is the smallest meaningful unit of play, the length of which is defined by the rules of the particular title is being played (e.g. Pong, Galaga, Monopoly). Typically if the phrase "Game Over" appears, of if a player can jump up and down shouting "I won!", a game has ended.</p>

<p>Example: Players A, B, C, and D compete in a game of Scrabble. When all of the tiles are exhausted, the game is over.</p>

<h3>2. Round</h3>
<p>A round refers to a set of games played on the same title. The rules of the tournament will likely call for multiple games of a title to be played in a particular round. The thinking behind this is that we wish to account for the fact that even good players have terrible luck.</p>

<p>Example: Players A, B, C, and D have played 3 games of Scrabble. Tournament rules may state that each player's final score is determined by their average score in the 3 games.</p>

<h3>3. Stage</h3>
<p>A stage refers to a set of rounds, typically 3 or 4, after which players are ranked and potentially eliminated from the tournament. </p>

<p>Example: After playing several games each of Scrabble, Tag, and Tetris, in Rounds 1, 2, and 3 respectively, Players A through H are ranked in order of their composite score, and the top 2 are selected to advance to a later Stage of the tournament.</p>

<h3>4. Tournament</h3>
<p>The tournament itself consists of a series of stages, with some number of the highest scorers in each stage advancing to the next stage.</p>
