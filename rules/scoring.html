title: Rules - Scoring
---

<section>

<p>To arrive at a score that reflects the skill and luck with which a player competed across a number of different games, we use a composite scoring system. At the end of each round, each player will receive a number of points, depending on how well he or she performed.</p>

<h3>Example Round 1: Galaga</h3>

<p>In this round, Galaga is being played as a series of 3 single player games. Each player plays, and takes the highest score across all of their games. All of the players then receive a number of points equal to their score divided by the highest score in the cohort. The highest scoring player receives 1 point toward advancement in the tournament.</p>

<table>
  <tr><th colspan="3">Round 1: Galaga</th></tr>
  <tr><th>Player</th><th>Game Score</th><th>Composite Score</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Alice</td><td align="right">10248</td><td align="right">0.07988</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Bob</td><td align="right">103924</td><td align="right">0.81006</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Claire</td><td align="right">128292</td><td align="right">1.0000</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Dennis</td><td align="right">89090</td><td align="right">0.69443</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Eve</td><td align="right">78982</td><td align="right">0.61564</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Fred</td><td align="right">82723</td><td align="right">0.64480</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Gloria</td><td align="right">65502</td><td align="right">0.51057</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Henry</td><td align="right">40293</td><td align="right">0.31407</td></tr>  
</table>


<h3>Example Round 2: Settlers of Catan</h3>

<p>If a round is played with 4-player games of Settlers of Catan, each player's composite score can be determined as the number of Victory Points with which he or she ends the game. When there are enough players to require multiple simultaneous games, multiple players can receive 1.0000 composite points toward the next stage.</p>

<table>
  <tr><th colspan="3">Round 2: Settlers of Catan, Table #1</th></tr>
  <tr><th>Player</th><th>Game Score</th><th>Composite Score</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Alice</td><td align="right">7</td><td align="right">0.7000</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Bob</td><td align="right">8</td><td align="right">0.8000</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Claire</td><td align="right">10</td><td align="right">1.0000</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Dennis</td><td align="right">2</td><td align="right">0.2000</td></tr>
</table>

<table>
  <tr><th colspan="3">Round 2: Settlers of Catan, Table #2</th></tr>
  <tr><th>Player</th><th>Game Score</th><th>Composite Score</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Eve</td><td align="right">10</td><td align="right">1.0000</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Fred</td><td align="right">9</td><td align="right">0.9000</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Gloria</td><td align="right">6</td><td align="right">0.6000</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Henry</td><td align="right">7</td><td align="right">0.7000</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Standings</h3>

<table>
  <tr><th colspan="3">Standings After Round 2</th></tr>
  <tr><th>Rank</th><th>Player</th><th>Score</th></tr>
  <tr><td>1</td><td>Claire</td><td align="right">2.00000</td></tr>
  <tr><td>2</td><td>Eve</td><td align="right">1.651564</td></tr>
  <tr><td>3</td><td>Bob</td><td align="right">1.61006</td></tr>
  <tr><td>4</td><td>Fred</td><td align="right">1.54480</td></tr>
  <tr><td>5</td><td>Gloria</td><td align="right">1.11057</td></tr>
  <tr><td>6</td><td>Dennis</td><td align="right">0.89443</td></tr>
  <tr><td>7</td><td>Henry</td><td align="right">0.81407</td></tr>
  <tr><td>8</td><td>Alice</td><td align="right">0.77899</td></tr>
</table>

<p>In this example of a 2 round stage, it's likely that Claire and Eve would advance to a subsequent stage.</p>
<p>At least one game in each stage should have all players competing for a single high score. This will help reduce the frequency of ties within a stage.</p>
