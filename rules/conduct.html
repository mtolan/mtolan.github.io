title: Rules - Code of Conduct
---

<section>
<p>In addition to the rules specific to each individual game, the Tournament at large will have additional rules. The sole intention of these rules is to provide a fun and welcoming environment that encourages players to come round again the next time we have a tournament.</p>

<h2>Rules</h2>

1. Don't be a dick

<h2>Enforcement</h2>

<p>Violations of the tournament code of conduct will be sanctioned similar to the given in soccer matches. Possible penalties include</p>

<h3>1. Warning</h3>

<p>Players can be warned that a particular action is in violation of the code of conduct, and that a repeat occurrence will lead to more significant sanctions.</p>

<h3>2. Yellow Card</h3>

<p>A player that continues a particular violation after a warning, or who willfully violates the code of conduct where a warning would be inadequate is shown a yellow card. A second yellow card received during a single round results in an automatic red card.</p>

<h3>3. Red Card</h3>

<p>A player who is shown a red card is immediately disqualified from the round currently in progress, and required to vacate the immediate area where the round is being conducted. The player will receive a score of 0.0 for that round.</p>

<h3>4. Black Card</h3>

<p>Players who are shown a black card by tournament staff are immediately disqualified from the tournament and will be immediately escorted from the premises by a member of Tournament Security. A player shown a black card will be ineligible to compete in events for not less than 12 months.</p>
